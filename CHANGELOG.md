# Changelog

## [1.10.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

**Taxonomy — Drag-and-Drop Category Reordering**
- Categories on the Taxonomy Editor can now be reordered by dragging the grip handle (⠿) up or down
- Installed `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, and `@dnd-kit/utilities`
- `SortableCategoryRow` uses `useSortable` from `@dnd-kit/sortable`; drag handle carries `attributes` and `listeners`; dragging item rendered at 50% opacity with elevated z-index
- `PointerSensor` with `activationConstraint: { distance: 5 }` prevents accidental drag when clicking rename/deactivate buttons
- Optimistic reorder: `arrayMove` applied immediately in state; `PUT /api/categories` persists in background; reverts via re-fetch on error
- Drag hint ("Drag the ⠿ handle to reorder categories") shown when more than one category exists
- New `PUT /api/categories` endpoint: accepts `{ order: [{id, order}] }` and batch-writes `order` fields via Firestore batch

## [1.9.0] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

**Scan Page — Second Shift Edge Case**
- An employee who completed a full shift today (normal clock-in → clock-out) and scanned the QR code again incorrectly saw "Forgot to log your start time?" — fixed
- `alreadyCheckedOut` condition now also requires `manualEntry === true` OR missing `checkInTime`; normal completed shifts no longer trigger the manual-entry path
- `lastCheckout` API payload extended to include `totalHours` and `manualEntry` fields (previously only `checkOutTime` was returned)
- `CheckInScreen` gains optional `priorHoursToday` prop; when set > 0, shows an informational amber note: "Starting a new shift — you already worked Xh today."
- All five "View my hours" buttons on the scan page corrected from `/dashboard` → `/dashboard/history`

## [1.8.0] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

**Mobile Navigation — Hamburger Menu**
- Dashboard navigation tabs overflowed horizontally on portrait mobile; replaced with a hamburger menu for mobile viewports
- Desktop tab bar hidden on mobile (`hidden md:flex`); hamburger button shown on mobile only (`flex md:hidden`)
- Mobile dropdown: full-width, slides in below the header; each item `min-h-[44px]` for touch targets
- Active route shown with warm-brown dot indicator; menu closes on route change or outside pointer-down
- User info and Sign Out in dropdown footer
- `overflow-x-hidden` and `min-w-0` added to dashboard layout to eliminate residual horizontal overflow
- `.scrollbar-hide` utility added to `globals.css` for desktop tab bar

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-06

### Fixed

**Employee Status Strip — "No previous shifts" Always Shown**
- The status strip on the employee overview always displayed "No previous shifts on record" even for employees with completed shifts
- Root cause: `GET /api/checkin` used `.where('status', '==', 'checked-out').orderBy('checkOutTime', 'desc')` which requires a Firestore composite index that did not exist; Firestore threw silently, catch returned `{ checkedIn: false }` with no `lastCheckout`
- Fixed by removing `.orderBy()` from the query and sorting the `.limit(50)` results in memory by `checkOutTime`

**History Page — Hours by Day**
- Rewrote `/dashboard/history` to group completed shifts by ET date instead of showing raw clock events
- Each day card shows total hours for the day; each shift shows in→out time range, facility, badges (Manual/Remote)
- If a shift has allocations, the card is expandable to show a function breakdown bar
- Total hours across all fetched records shown in the page header
- 30 days per page pagination

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-06

### Changed

**Removed Product dimension — simplified to Category → Function**

- **`types/index.ts`**: Removed `Product` interface entirely
- **`app/api/products/route.ts`**: Deleted (GET/POST/PATCH routes no longer exist)
- **`components/FunctionSelector.tsx`**: Removed "Browse by Product" toggle and product accordion; removed `products` and `ProductWithFunctions` props; component now shows Recent + Browse by Category only; simpler internal state (no `mode`, no `expandedProducts`)
- **`components/CheckOutScreen.tsx`**: Removed `ProductWithFunctions` interface, `products` state, and `/api/products` fetch from `loadSurveyData`; `FunctionSelector` no longer receives a `products` prop
- **`app/dashboard/taxonomy/page.tsx`**: Removed Products tab, tab bar, all product state (`addingProduct`, `editingProductId`, `assigningFnsFor`, etc.), all product API calls, and `fnProductMap` product-name badge display; page is now a single-view Category → Function tree with `+ Add Category` always visible
- **`scripts/seed.ts`**: Removed `PRODUCTS` constant and product seeding block; `--clear` / `--reset` still deletes the `products` collection as a legacy cleanup step; `functionIdMap` removed (was only needed for product assignment)
- **`app/api/recent-functions/route.ts`**: No changes needed — already product-free
- TypeScript passes `npx tsc --noEmit` with zero errors

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

**Timecard Edit Modal — Allocation Editing**
- Managers and admins can now edit time allocations directly in the timecard edit modal
- Existing allocations render as interactive sliders (same proportional logic as the checkout survey): move one slider and the others adjust; minimum 5% per function; live percentage display
- Remove a function from the allocation with the × button — percentage redistributes proportionally
- "Add a function" dropdown: all active functions grouped by category (optgroup); already-allocated functions are hidden from the list; selecting one adds it at an even split; resets after selection
- If a timecard has no allocations, the manager can build one from scratch using the add dropdown
- Save is blocked while allocations sum to less than 100% — amber warning shows the current total
- The Save button is disabled if allocations exist but are unbalanced
- `PATCH /api/timecards` now sets `allocationsEdited: true` whenever an allocations array is saved
- New "Alloc edited" badge (blue) in the timecards table for records where `allocationsEdited` is true
- Modal is now scrollable (`max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`) to accommodate the extra section
- `allocationsEdited?: boolean` added to the `Timecard` type

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

**Analytics Dashboard (`/dashboard/analytics`)**
- New "Analytics" tab in the manager and admin nav (after Reports, before Taxonomy)
- Filters: date range (defaults to current ET week), facility, employee; "Run" button with empty-date guard
- Employee dropdown auto-populates from employees found in the selected period
- Auto-runs on page load with the default week so data is visible immediately
- Section 1 — 4 summary cards: Total Hours Worked, Total Shifts, Avg Shift Length, Employees Worked
- Section 2 — Horizontal bar chart: Hours by Function (Chart.js, brand brown `#7B604B`)
- Section 3 — Donut chart: Hours by Category (brand palette), legend shows name + percentage
- Section 4 — Employee Breakdown table: Name, Hours (mono), Top Function, Shifts; alternating row colours; header in `near-black` with tan text
- Section 5 — Daily Hours Trend line chart (filled area, brand brown)
- All charts skip empty state and show "No shifts logged for this period." instead
- New API route `GET /api/analytics`: requires manager role; calculates all five sections in one round-trip; resolves function→category hierarchy from Firestore; generates full date range for daily trend (zero-fills missing days)
- Installed `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

**Feature 1 — Employee Status & Weekly Activity**
- Employee overview shows weekly hours (Mon–Sun ET) and shift count for the current week
- Recent activity feed shows last 8 clock-in/clock-out events with relative day labels (Today/Yesterday/day name)
- "See all" link opens the new History page
- All times displayed in Eastern Time via Intl API (no client-side library)

**Feature 2 — Employee History Page (`/dashboard/history`)**
- Full clock event log: each shift generates a clock-in row and a clock-out row
- Client-side pagination, 30 events per page
- Shows date, event type, ET time, facility name, map link (if location captured), Manual/Remote badges
- New "History" nav item visible to employees in DashboardNav

**Feature 3 — Forgot to Clock In (Already Checked Out)**
- Scan page detects when employee already completed a shift today (`lastCheckout` same-day check)
- Shows "Already clocked out" screen with option to log a missed clock-in
- Time picker pre-filled with today's date; validates clock-in < clock-out
- New `POST /api/manual-check-in`: creates completed timecard with `manualEntry: true`

**Feature 4 — Double Scan Confirmation**
- Scan page shows a confirmation screen before proceeding to clock-out when employee is already checked in
- "Clock out" proceeds to CheckOutScreen; "Not now" dismisses to dashboard

**Feature 5 — Forgot to Clock Out Yesterday**
- Scan page detects open shifts from a previous ET day (`openShiftFromPreviousDay` from `/api/checkin`)
- Shows date + time of the open shift; datetime-local picker defaults to 5 PM on the shift's date
- New `POST /api/close-shift`: closes old shift with `manualEntry: true`, validates checkOut > checkIn
- After closing, employee can choose to clock in for the current day

**Feature 6 — "Time Not Logged" Badge**
- Timecards table shows red "Time not logged" badge for checked-out records with no allocations

**Feature 7 — Remote Pending at Checkout**
- `remotePendingAtCheckout: true` flag stored when employee clocks out while remote approval is still pending
- "Remote pending" orange badge shown in timecards table

**Feature 8 — 12-Hour Long Shift Alert**
- New `GET /api/cron/check-long-shifts` secured by `x-cron-secret` header
- Sends manager email for any shift checked in for ≥ 12 hours without a clock-out
- `sentLongShiftAlert: true` flag prevents duplicate emails per shift

**Feature 9 — Manager Edit Modal**
- Edit button opens a modal dialog (replaces inline edit row)
- Datetime-local pickers labeled Eastern Time; values converted server-side via `fromETLocal()`
- Required edit note field; PATCH endpoint recalculates `totalHours` automatically
- "Edited" sage badge shown in timecards table; prior edit note shown read-only in modal
- Also shows "Manual entry" (amber) and "Remote pending" (orange) badges

**Feature 10 — Timezone: All UTC in Firestore, All Display in ET**
- `lib/tz.ts`: server-side helpers using `date-fns-tz` (`fromETLocal`, `toETLocal`, `etDateStr`, `isTodayET`, `isYesterdayET`, `formatTimeET`, `relDayLabel`, `forgotCheckOutLabel`, `getWeekStartUTC`)
- Client components use Intl API exclusively (`toETDatetimeLocal`, `formatTimeET`, `isTodayET`, `getTodayET`, `getYesterdayET`)
- `date-fns` and `date-fns-tz` added to dependencies

### Changed

- `EmployeeOverview` now accepts `weekStartUTC` prop (computed server-side); fetches weekly timecards only
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` passes `weekStartUTC` from `getWeekStartUTC()` to `EmployeeOverview`
- `CheckInScreen` "success" state now navigates to `checkInDone` (not CheckOutScreen), avoiding accidental immediate checkout
- Timecards page filter panel now includes Employee ID input

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-06

### Changed

**Check-Out Flow Redesign**
- Checkout is triggered immediately when the employee opens the checkout screen (no confirmation step)
- Sticky "You're clocked out. — Undo" banner at top: near-black bg, off-white text, tan "Undo" link
- Undo reverses the checkout (status → checked-in, clears checkOutTime/totalHours/allocations) via new `/api/undo-checkout`
- Scan page shows "Clocked back in." confirmation screen after undo
- `/api/checkout` POST no longer requires allocations; allocations saved separately via new PATCH endpoint
- Geolocation saved with allocations PATCH, not at initial clock-out

**Allocation Survey Redesign**
- "Same as last time" button (near-black) loads all functions + percentages from most recent shift instantly
- Recent functions shown as cards in a 2-column grid: function name, category name, "X% last shift", "Yesterday"/"Last shift" label
- "Save" button replaces "Review & confirm" and "Done for the day" — one tap submits after sliders reach 100%
- `/api/recent-functions` now returns `categoryName`, `lastUsedPercentage`, `lastShiftDate` per function, plus `lastShift` array for "Same as last time"

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-05

### Changed

- Guard: last remaining facility cannot be deleted

**API Fixes**
- `/api/recent-functions` always returns valid JSON `{"recent": []}` as fallback
- `/api/facilities` accepts `?id=` for single-document lookup (fixes scan page 404)
- Inactive taxonomy items filtered in memory on all GET routes (avoids Firestore composite index)
